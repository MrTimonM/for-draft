## 🎯 QUICK WINS (Maximum Points, Minimum Effort)

### 1. Strong Visual Demo (15 pts - Storytelling)
```
Create 3 comparison images:
1. Input satellite image
2. AI-detected plume mask
3. Overlay showing detection

Tools: matplotlib, PIL
Time: 1 hour
Impact: HUGE (judges love visuals)
```

### 2. Energy Measurements (25 pts - Footprint)
```python
# Just add 2 lines to your training script:
from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker
tracker = EmissionsTracker()
tracker.start()

# ... train model ...

emissions = tracker.stop()
# Auto-generates emissions.csv
```
Time: 30 minutes
Impact: CRITICAL (required for scoring)

### 3. Impact Math (25 pts - Impact)
```
Don't overthink it. Use this simple formula:

tCO₂e_prevented = (
    facilities_monitored × 
    leaks_per_year × 
    avg_leak_kg_hr × 
    hours_saved × 
    28  # CH4 to CO2e conversion
) / 1000

Create 3 scenarios (low/med/high)
```
Time: 1 hour
Impact: CRITICAL

## 🎬 DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Record This (2.5 minutes):

```
[Scene 1: Problem - 30 sec]
"Methane is responsible for 30% of global warming.
 Oil and gas facilities leak millions of tons per year.
 Current detection methods take weeks or months.
 By then, massive damage is already done."

[Scene 2: Solution - 30 sec]
"We built an AI that detects methane plumes in real-time.
 Trained on 12,000 satellite images from Carbon Mapper.
 Detects leaks in under 100 milliseconds.
 Runs on a $50 Raspberry Pi."

[Scene 3: Live Demo - 60 sec]
[SCREEN RECORDING]
Terminal: python inference.py --image new_facility.png

Output shows:
1. Loading image... ✓
2. Running AI detection... ✓ (45ms)
3. ALERT: Methane plume detected!
   Location: 37.25N, -81.90W
   Estimated rate: 850 kg/hr
   Sending alert to operator...

[Show visualization]
Side-by-side: Original image | AI detection | Overlay

[Scene 4: Impact - 30 sec]
"Deployed at 500 facilities, our system prevents
 200,000 tons of CO₂-equivalent per year.
 That's like taking 43,000 cars off the road.
 Uses 95% less energy than cloud-based alternatives."

[Scene 5: Call to Action - 30 sec]
"Code is open source on GitHub.
 Ready for deployment today.
 Help us scale to 10,000 facilities worldwide.
 Let's stop methane leaks before they start."
