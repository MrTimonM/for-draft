## Metrics

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Optimized |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **IoU Score** | 0.92 | 0.90 |
| **F1 Score** | 0.95 | 0.94 |
| **Precision** | 0.94 | 0.93 |

### Decision Threshold
Default threshold: **0.5** (adjustable based on use case)
- Lower threshold: Higher sensitivity, more false positives
- Higher threshold: Higher specificity, more false negatives

### Trade-offs
- **Optimized model** trades 2% accuracy for 55% energy savings and 51% faster inference
- Suitable for real-time deployment where speed and efficiency matter

## Training Data

### Dataset: Carbon Mapper Methane Plume Database

**Source:** [Carbon Mapper](https://carbonmapper.org/)  
**Size:** 12,000 labeled methane plume detections  
**Date Range:** 2019-2024  
**Geographic Coverage:** Global (focus on USA)

**Data Composition:**
- **Sensors**: AVIRIS-3, Tanager, GAO, and others
- **Sectors**: Oil & gas (75%), landfills (15%), agriculture (5%), other (5%)
- **Plume Sizes**: 20-5000 pixels
- **Emission Rates**: 10-5000 kg/hr
- **Terrains**: Desert, grassland, urban, industrial, water

**Data Split:**
- Training: 70% (8,400 samples)
- Validation: 15% (1,800 samples)
- Test: 15% (1,800 samples)

### Preprocessing
1. RGB images resized to 256x256
2. Normalization: pixel values scaled to [0, 1]
3. Masks converted to binary (0 = no plume, 1 = plume)
4. Data augmentation: random rotations, flips

### Known Limitations
- Dataset biased toward oil & gas facilities
- Limited representation of small plumes (<20 pixels)
- Primarily US-based data
- Specific sensor types may not generalize to all satellites

- Cloud shadows
- Water bodies with sun glint
- Industrial buildings with specific patterns

**Rate**: 5-7% of test images

### False Negatives
Common causes:
- Very small plumes (<20 pixels)
- Low contrast against background
- Partially obscured by clouds
- Edge cases at image boundaries

**Rate**: 3-5% of test plumes

## Caveats and Recommendations

### Recommendations

✅ **DO:**
- Use in conjunction with human expertise
- Verify high-confidence detections
- Regularly retrain with new data
- Monitor performance in deployment
- Document all decisions based on model output

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rely solely on model without verification
- Use for legal enforcement without additional evidence
- Deploy without understanding limitations
- Ignore false positives/negatives
- Use outside intended domain

### Deployment Best Practices

1. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust based on cost of false positives vs false negatives
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine with other detection methods
3. **Human Review**: Include expert verification for critical decisions
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics in production
5. **Feedback Loop**: Collect edge cases for retraining

### Known Limitations

1. **Small Plumes**: Accuracy drops for plumes <20 pixels
2. **Weather**: Performance degrades in cloudy conditions
3. **Novel Sensors**: May not generalize to new satellite types
4. **Geographic Bias**: Primarily trained on US data
5. **Emission Estimation**: Simplified calculation (needs wind data for accuracy)
