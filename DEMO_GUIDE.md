# üé¨ Demo Video Script & Guide

## üìπ Video Overview

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Format:** Screen recording + voiceover  
**Style:** Professional but engaging  
**Platform:** Upload to YouTube (unlisted) or Loom

## üéØ Video Structure

### Opening (0:00-0:20) - Problem Statement
**Visual:** Title slide or code editor  
**Script:**
```
"Methane is 28 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.
Oil and gas facilities leak millions of tonnes annually, 
but these leaks often go undetected for months.

What if we could detect them in real-time?
In under 100 milliseconds?"
```

### Demo Part 1 (0:20-0:50) - Live Detection
**Visual:** Streamlit app  
**Actions:**
1. Show interface
2. Upload satellite image
3. Click "Detect Plumes" button
4. Results appear instantly

**Script:**
```
"I built an AI system that analyzes satellite imagery in real-time.
Watch this...
[Upload and detect]
Detected in 42 milliseconds!
The system identified a methane plume with 92% confidence,
covering 3.5% of the image,
emitting an estimated 280 kilograms per hour."
```

### Demo Part 2 (0:50-1:20) - Impact Visualization
**Visual:** Impact calculations in app  
**Script:**
```
"That's 2,100 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year from this one leak.
Equal to 456 cars or 84,000 trees needed to offset it.

Now imagine monitoring 1,000 facilities.
We could prevent 50,000 to 500,000 tonnes of CO2e annually.
That's like taking 100,000 cars off the road."
```

### Technical Highlights (1:20-1:50) - Green AI
**Visual:** Performance charts/metrics  
**Script:**
```
"But here's what makes this special - it's sustainable AI.

My optimized model uses 55% less energy than the baseline,
has 73% fewer parameters,
and runs on any laptop - no GPU required.

Training emissions: just 11 grams of CO2.
But detecting and fixing leaks saves 50,000 tonnes per year.

That's a return on investment of 4.9 million to one.
Our training carbon footprint is recovered in 0.007 seconds of deployment."
```

### Speed Benchmark (1:50-2:10) - Performance
**Visual:** Terminal showing benchmark results  
**Script:**
```
"Let's prove the speed claim.
[Run benchmark]
Average inference: 42 milliseconds.
That's 23 frames per second.
Well under our 100 millisecond target.

Production ready, real-time capable."
```

### Closing (2:10-2:30) - Call to Action
**Visual:** GitHub page or summary slide  
**Script:**
```
"This is open source under MIT license.
Complete code, trained models, and documentation on GitHub.

Join me in fighting climate change through sustainable AI.
Star the repo, use the code, help detect methane leaks.

Together we can make a difference.
