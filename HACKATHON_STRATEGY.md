## 💡 IMPACT MATH (Required for Track B)

### How to Calculate Your Impact:

#### Scenario 1: CONSERVATIVE (Low)
```
Assumptions:
- Monitor 100 oil & gas facilities
- Detect 10 leaks per year
- Average leak: 1,000 kg/hr CH4
- Detection reduces leak duration: 30 days → 1 day
- Methane to CO2e: CH4 × 28 (20-year GWP)

Calculation:
- Prevented leak time: 29 days = 696 hours
- Prevented CH4 per leak: 696 hrs × 1,000 kg/hr = 696,000 kg
- CO2e per leak: 696,000 × 28 = 19,488,000 kg = 19,488 tCO₂e
- Total (10 leaks): 194,880 tCO₂e/year

LOW ESTIMATE: ~50,000 tCO₂e/year prevented
```

#### Scenario 2: MEDIUM
```
- Monitor 500 facilities
- 25 leaks/year detected
- Average leak: 2,000 kg/hr
- 30 days → 2 days detection

MEDIUM ESTIMATE: ~200,000 tCO₂e/year prevented
```

#### Scenario 3: HIGH (Aggressive)
```
- Monitor 2,000 facilities globally
- 100 leaks/year
- Large leaks: 5,000 kg/hr
- 60 days → 3 days

HIGH ESTIMATE: ~500,000 tCO₂e/year prevented
```

### Create impact_math.csv:
```csv
scenario,facilities_monitored,leaks_per_year,avg_emission_kg_hr,baseline_duration_days,ai_duration_days,tCO2e_prevented_yr,confidence
low,100,10,1000,30,1,50000,high
medium,500,25,2000,30,2,200000,medium
high,2000,100,5000,60,3,500000,low
```

## 🔬 HOW TO PROVE & DEMONSTRATE IT WORKS

### Proof Strategy:

#### 1. **Quantitative Metrics** (Technical Quality - 25 pts)
```python
# In your evaluation script:
results = {
    'precision': 0.92,      # 92% of detections are real plumes
    'recall': 0.88,         # 88% of real plumes detected
    'f1_score': 0.90,       # Overall accuracy
    'inference_time': '45ms',  # Fast enough for real-time
    'false_positive_rate': 0.08  # 8% false alarms
}
```

#### 2. **Visual Proof** (Storytelling - 15 pts)
Create comparison images:
```
[Original Satellite Image] → [AI Detection] → [Ground Truth]
Show 10-20 examples:
- ✅ True Positives: Correctly detected plumes
- ✅ True Negatives: Correctly identified no plume
- ⚠️  False Positives: Honest about errors
- 📊 Confusion Matrix
```

#### 3. **Real-Time Demo** (Impact - 25 pts)
```python
# Live demonstration script
def live_demo():
    print("Loading new satellite image...")
    image = load_image("test_facility.png")
    
    print("Running AI detection...")
    start = time.time()
    mask = model.predict(image)
    duration = time.time() - start
    
    if has_plume(mask):
        alert = f"🚨 ALERT: Methane plume detected!"
        estimate_emission_rate(mask)
        send_notification(alert)
    
    print(f"Analysis complete in {duration*1000:.1f}ms")
```

#### 4. **Validation on Test Set** (Reproducibility)
```python
# test_validation.py
test_dataset = load_test_data()  # 1,800 unseen samples

results = evaluate_model(model, test_dataset)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {results['accuracy']:.2%}")
print(f"Test F1-Score: {results['f1']:.3f}")

# Show per-sector performance
for sector in ['oil_gas', 'landfill', 'agriculture']:
    sector_f1 = results[sector]['f1']
    print(f"{sector}: F1={sector_f1:.3f}")
```

## ⚡ FOOTPRINT MEASUREMENT (Required - 25 pts)

### Use CodeCarbon to Measure Energy:

```python
# measure_energy.py
from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker

# Baseline: Full model, no optimization
tracker = EmissionsTracker()
tracker.start()

# Train model
model = train_full_model(epochs=50)

emissions = tracker.stop()
print(f"Baseline CO₂: {emissions:.4f} kg")

# Optimized: Quantized model
tracker.start()
model_quantized = train_quantized_model(epochs=50)
emissions_opt = tracker.stop()

print(f"Optimized CO₂: {emissions_opt:.4f} kg")
print(f"Reduction: {(1 - emissions_opt/emissions)*100:.1f}%")
```

### Create evidence.csv:
```csv
